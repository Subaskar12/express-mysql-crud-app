The CRUD API (Create, Read, Update, Delete) serves as the backend for a web application that manages user information. It enables operations such as adding new users, retrieving user details, updating user information, and deleting user records. The API is designed to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and the database, providing a robust foundation for user management within the application.
